I am a Research Scientist in the HPCToolkit project team at Rice University, supervised by Professor John Mellor-Crummey. I received my PhD degree from the Computer Sciences Department, University of Wisconsin â€“ Madison in Dec. 2018 advised by Professor Barton Miller.

I have broad research interests in Systems, High-Performance Computing, Software Engineering, Security, and Programming Languages.
The common theme of my research across all these different areas
is to develop foundational techniques for binary code analysis and instrumentation
to derive deep insights on machine code and drive the aforementioned research areas.

My research has been based on two long-live open-source projects:
the [Dyninst binary analysis and instrumentation toolkit](https://github.com/dyninst/dyninst) and
the [HPCToolkit performance measurement and analysis tool suite](https://github.com/HPCToolkit/hpctoolkit).
I believe sustainable software is a key component for system research.
